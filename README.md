# Insurance-Analytics
This project focuses on analyzing insurance datasets to uncover business insights related to revenue, client opportunities, and performance tracking. The analysis was replicated across Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau, ensuring hands-on experience with multiple tools used in real-world data analytics.
Datasets Used

**Brokerage.csv** – Core file tracking policies sold, their status, income class, and revenue details.

**Fees.csv** – Additional charges linked to policies.

**Budgets.csv** – Revenue goals for New, Cross Sell, and Renewal policies.

**Invoices.csv** – Records of client payments and transaction details.

**Meetings.csv** – Client interactions by account executives.

**Opportunities.csv** – Sales opportunities with revenue potential and stages.

**Key Objectives**

Track revenue from policies, fees, and invoices.

Compare actual achievements vs. budgets (targets).

Analyze sales opportunities and their conversion into revenue.

Evaluate account executive performance via meetings and invoices.

Build interactive dashboards and reports to visualize findings.

**Methodology**

**Data Preparation & Cleaning** – Performed separately in Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau.

**Analysis** – Wrote SQL queries for revenue, achievement %, opportunities, and meetings.

****Visualization** **– Built dashboards in Power BI & Tableau for revenue tracking, KPIs, and funnel analysis.

**Comparison** – Replicated the same analysis across all four tools to understand flexibility and strengths of each.

**Outcomes**

Clear insights into revenue contributions by income class (New, Cross Sell, Renewal).

Achievement % against budgets for each policy type.

Meeting and opportunity funnel analysis to measure sales effectiveness.

Identification of top-performing executives, opportunities, and revenue sources.

Interactive dashboards that help decision-makers track business performance.

**Tools & Skills**

Excel (Power Pivot, Charts, PivotTables)

SQL (queries, aggregations, joins, KPIs)

Power BI (DAX, KPIs, slicers, dashboards)

Tableau (visualizations, insights, comparisons)

This project demonstrates end-to-end analytics skills — from raw data preparation to visualization and storytelling — applied in multiple tools to simulate real-world problem-solving.
